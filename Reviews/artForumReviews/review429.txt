Sofia Coppola, Somewhere, 2010, stills from a color film, 97 minutes.
Sofia Coppola’s films have been praised as “sweet and sad at the same time” (Roger Ebert on Lost in Translation [2003]) and “highly theatrical and yet also intimate and informal” (A. O. Scott on Marie Antoinette [2006]). Her latest feature, Somewhere, is a tribute to Los Angeles’s Chateau Marmont, and in many ways it is also a reflection on her own experiences at the landmark hotel. The film follows Stephen Dorff’s lead as a Hollywood actor whose personal life and relationship with his eleven-year-old daughter, played by Elle Fanning, undergo subtle transformations. A trailer for the film can be found here.
Here, Coppola discusses her approach to crafting the script and the various tributes in the film. Last September, Somewhere was awarded the Golden Lion at the sixty-seventh Venice International Film Festival. The film opens in select US cities on December 22.
